# Hybrid Assistant Client Implementation Phases

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure
- [ ] Initialize Tauri 2.0 project with Rust backend and React/TypeScript frontend
- [ ] Set up project structure (src/core/, ui/, models/ directories)
- [ ] Configure dependencies: Tauri CLI, Rust crates (llama.cpp, ONNX Runtime, sysinfo, etc.)
- [ ] Implement configuration schema and feature flags
- [ ] Set up build scripts and CI/CD basics
- [ ] Create basic logging and error handling

## Phase 2: Core Hardware Detection & Model Management
- [ ] Implement HardwareProfile struct and detection logic
- [ ] Implement hardware tier assignment and profiling
- [ ] Create model profiles and selection logic
- [ ] Integrate llama.cpp for GGUF model loading/inference (heavy/light tiers)
- [ ] Add ONNX Runtime for NPU/GPU acceleration
- [ ] Implement model downloading and caching system
- [ ] Build model validation and fallback mechanisms

## Phase 3: Speech & AI Inference Pipeline
- [ ] Integrate Kokoro TTS (ONNX implementation)
- [ ] Add faster-whisper STT (C++ binding to Rust)
- [ ] Create unified speech processing trait implementations
- [ ] Develop DeviceTraits for Cross-Platform speech I/O
- [ ] Implement conversation mode handling (voice/text modes)
- [ ] Add speech calibration and voice activity detection
- [ ] Test speech quality and latency optimizations

## Phase 4: Memory & Conversation System
- [ ] Set up SQLite for chat history storage
- [ ] Integrate RocksDB for vector embeddings
- [ ] Add Qdrant-lite for semantic retrieval
- [ ] Implement Redis short-term caching
- [ ] Create conversation threading and context management
- [ ] Build memory export (Markdown format) and search functionality
- [ ] Add conversation modes (Assistant, Coding, Creative, Analyzer)

## Phase 5: UI Development & Integration
- [ ] Build React/TypeScript UI components (chat, settings, status)
- [ ] Implement multimodal interface (text input, voice buttons)
- [ ] Create hardware tier badges and real-time status indicators
- [ ] Add system tray functionality
- [ ] Develop aggregate search/research mode interface
- [ ] Integrate all Rust backend APIs via Tauri IPC
- [ ] Implement dark/light themes and responsive design

## Phase 6: Routing & Advanced Features
- [ ] Build RoutingEngine for local/cloud decisions
- [ ] Implement BudgetManager for token tracking
- [ ] Add cloud provider configurations (OpenAI, etc., up to 4 active)
- [ ] Create fallback chains and provider switching
- [ ] Stub backend interfaces for memory sync
- [ ] Add telemetry (opt-in) and crash reporting
- [ ] Implement sandboxed model execution isolation

## Phase 7: Testing, Performance & Deployment
- [ ] Write unit tests (hardware detection, model inference, speech processing)
- [ ] Create integration tests (end-to-end conversations, provider failover)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking (startup <3s, inference <2s)
- [ ] Complete cross-platform testing (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- [ ] Package for distribution (single binary with model cache)
- [ ] Documentation and quick start guide
- [ ] Final security audit and privacy compliance
