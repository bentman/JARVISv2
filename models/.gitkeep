# Models Directory

This directory is for AI model files (.gguf) and voice models (.onnx).

Models are not included in the repository due to size. 
Use the setup scripts to download required models:

Windows: ./scripts/setup/get-models.ps1
macOS/Linux: ./scripts/setup/get-models.sh

Models will be downloaded to this directory and verified with checksums.json.
