# Local AI Assistant - User Instructions

## Overview

The Local AI Assistant is a privacy-focused, local-first AI assistant that runs entirely on your hardware. All processing occurs on your device by default, ensuring maximum privacy and data control. This guide will help you understand how to use the assistant's features effectively.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements
- Modern multi-core processor
- Sufficient RAM for selected models
- GPU acceleration support (optional but recommended)
- SSD storage for model caching

### Initial Setup
The Local AI Assistant automatically profiles your hardware to select the optimal configuration:
1. CPU architecture and core count
2. GPU vendor, memory, and compute capabilities
3. Memory capacity and usage patterns
4. Specialized processors like NPUs
5. Disk space and network capabilities

The system will automatically select the appropriate performance profile based on your hardware:
- **Light Profile**: For systems with limited resources (e.g., 3-7B parameter models)
- **Medium Profile**: For mid-range systems with moderate GPU/NPU capabilities (e.g., 7-13B parameter models)
- **Heavy Profile**: For high-performance devices with sufficient memory to run large models (e.g., 13B+ parameter models)
- **NPU Optimized**: For neural processing units with specialized optimizations
- **API Integration**: Optional cloud fallback for unsupported tasks

## Core Features

### Chat Interface
- **Text Input**: Type your queries in the chat interface
- **Streaming Responses**: Receive real-time message updates
- **Conversation History**: Access persistent chat storage
- **Markdown Support**: Rich formatting for responses

### Voice Interaction
- **Wake Word Activation**: Use the wake word to activate voice mode hands-free
- **Voice Commands**: Speak naturally to interact with the assistant
- **Barge-in Support**: Interrupt responses to ask follow-up questions
- **Continuous Conversation**: Engage in natural, flowing dialogue

### Privacy Controls
- **Local Processing**: All data processing occurs on your device by default
- **Data Classification**: Automatic detection of sensitive information
- **Privacy Levels**: Adjust privacy settings based on your preferences
- **Data Retention**: Control how long conversations are stored

## Using the Assistant

### Interaction Modes
1. **Text Mode**: Traditional chat interface with rich formatting
2. **Voice Mode**: Hands-free interaction with continuous conversation
3. **Hybrid Mode**: Seamless switching between voice and text

### Intelligent Routing
The assistant uses a policy-driven system that prioritizes local-first processing:
- **Local Processing**: Standard tasks are processed on your device (priority)
- **Cloud-lite**: Small models for capability gaps in reasoning/coding
- **Cloud-heavy**: Large models for complex analysis (when local insufficient)

The system automatically considers:
- Hardware profiles and capabilities
- Privacy data classification (redaction/summarization for sensitive content)
- Budget governance with real-time tracking and predictions

### Memory Management
- **Short-term Memory**: Recent interactions for context
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent conversation history
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant past conversations
- **Privacy Controls**: Selective redaction of sensitive content

### Unified Search
The assistant can access information from multiple sources:
- Local memory (your conversation history)
- Vector embeddings (semantic retrieval)
- Search providers (web APIs)
- Cloud AI providers (when local processing insufficient)

Results are aggregated, ranked by relevance, with citations and summaries.

## Settings and Configuration

### Hardware Profile Override
- Manually adjust the performance profile if needed
- Override automatic hardware detection
- Customize model selection preferences

### Voice Settings
- Wake word customization
- Voice activation sensitivity
- Text-to-speech voice selection
- Audio quality preferences

### Privacy Settings
- Data retention period
- Sensitive content handling
- Local vs. cloud processing preferences
- Data encryption settings

## Privacy & Security

### Data Handling Principles
- Local-first processing with no default external data transmission
- Data encryption for conversation storage
- Classification system for sensitive information handling
- User controls for data retention and sharing

### Security Features
- End-to-end encryption for data protection
- Model integrity verification
- Secure inter-component communication
- Isolation of AI models and data processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Performance**: If responses are slow, consider switching to a lighter hardware profile
2. **Voice Activation**: Adjust microphone sensitivity or retrain the wake word
3. **Memory**: Clear conversation history if experiencing memory issues
4. **Privacy**: Review privacy settings if you notice unexpected cloud processing

## Advanced Features

### Customization
- Personalize responses based on your preferences
- Configure specialized knowledge for specific domains
- Set up custom commands and shortcuts

### Integration
- Export conversation history
- Connect with local tools and applications
