# Local AI Assistant - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Local AI Assistant is a privacy-focused, local-first AI assistant that runs entirely on user hardware. It provides chat, voice interaction, and reasoning capabilities while ensuring all data processing occurs locally by default.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Hardware Adaptive Architecture
- Automatic CPU/GPU/NPU detection
- Dynamic model selection based on hardware profile
- Three-tier system: Light (CPU), Medium (GPU/NPU), Heavy (High-end GPU)

### 2. Voice Interaction
- Wake word detection
- Speech-to-text conversion
- Text-to-speech synthesis
- Hands-free interaction

### 3. Chat Interface
- Real-time messaging with streaming responses
- Conversation history persistence
- Multi-modal interaction (text and voice)

### 4. Privacy-First Design
- End-to-end encryption for stored data
- Local processing by default
- Data classification and access controls
- No cloud dependencies

### 5. Cross-Platform Support
- Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop applications
- Consistent user experience across platforms
- Native performance on each platform
