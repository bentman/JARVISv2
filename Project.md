# Local-First AI Assistant Requirements Document

## Product Overview

A fully-functional, privacy-first desktop AI assistant that runs entirely on user hardware with automatic capability detection. Supports chat, reasoning, and coding tasks with voice interaction, maintaining all data processing locally by default. The assistant adapts to hardware configurations (CPU, GPU, NPU) for optimal performance across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Vision
Deliver a complete AI assistant that provides immediate and advanced value while prioritizing user privacy and local control. The product works seamlessly from basic conversations to complex tasks with zero external data transmission.

### Goals
1. **Full Local Privacy**: All data processing occurs locally by default with no cloud dependencies
2. **Hardware Adaptation**: Automatic detection and optimization for available hardware capabilities
3. **Voice Integration**: Complete voice interaction with wake word detection and bidirectional communication
4. **Cross-Platform Support**: Native applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux
5. **Minimal Setup**: One-command installation and deployment
6. **Intelligent Resource Management**: Optimized performance based on device specifications

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- Hardware capability detection and automatic model selection
- Voice interface with wake word detection, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech
- Chat interface with streaming responses and markdown support
- Local backend services for orchestration and data management
- Memory persistence for conversation history and semantic search
- Privacy controls and local processing enforcement
- Real-time status indicators and user settings

### Hardware Profiles
- **Light**: Basic tasks for lower-end hardware
- **Medium**: Enhanced capabilities for mid-range systems
- **Heavy**: Full feature set for high-performance devices
- **NPU Optimized**: Accelerated performance on neural processing hardware
- **API Integration**: Optional cloud fallback for unsupported tasks

### Interaction Modes
- **Voice Mode**: Hands-free interaction with continuous conversation
- **Text Mode**: Traditional chat interface with rich formatting
- **Hybrid Mode**: Seamless switching between voice and text

### Intelligent Routing System
Policy-driven logic prioritizing local-first processing with tiered escalation: local (priority), cloud-lite (small models for capability gaps in reasoning/coding), cloud-heavy (large models for complex analysis). Considers hardware profiles, privacy data classification (redaction/summarization for sensitive content), budget governance with real-time tracking and predictions.

### Unified Search Aggregation
System for integrated queries across multiple sources: local memory (conversation history), vector embeddings (semantic retrieval), search providers (web APIs like Bing/Google/Tavily), and cloud AI providers. Results aggregated, ranked by relevance, with citations, summaries, and configurable source preferences.
