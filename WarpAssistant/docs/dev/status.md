# Local AI Assistant - Implementation Status

## Current State

The Local AI Assistant is a fully-functional, privacy-first desktop AI assistant that runs entirely on user hardware. All core functionality has been implemented and tested.

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **Backend Services**
   - Core Assistant Service (FastAPI REST API)
   - Model Router Service (hardware detection, model selection)
   - Memory Service (conversation storage, semantic search)
   - Voice Service (wake word detection, STT, TTS)
   - Privacy Service (data classification, encryption)
   - Cache Service (Redis-backed caching)
   - Budget Service (cost tracking and limits)
   - Health Monitoring (service and model status)

2. **Frontend Application**
   - Chat interface with voice capabilities
   - Cross-platform desktop app (Tauri/Rust + React)
   - Responsive UI with streaming responses

3. **AI Capabilities**
   - Hardware-adaptive model routing (CPU/GPU/NPU)
   - Semantic search with FAISS vector embeddings
   - Voice interaction (wake word, STT, TTS)
   - Local-first processing with no cloud dependencies

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Docker Compose setup (backend + Redis)
   - Model management with integrity verification
   - Health checks and monitoring endpoints
   - Cross-platform development scripts

### ðŸš€ Ready for Deployment

The project is ready for immediate use in development environments. All core services are functional with:
- Automatic hardware detection and model selection
- Voice-enabled chat interface
- Semantic search capabilities
- Privacy controls and local data processing
- Budget monitoring and enforcement

### ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - Node.js 18+
   - Rust toolchain (for desktop packaging)

2. **Setup**
   ```bash
   # Download models
   ./scripts/get-models.sh  # Linux/macOS
   # or
   ./scripts/get-models.ps1  # Windows
   
   # Start services
   docker compose up -d
   
   # Start frontend
   cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
   ```

3. **Development**
   ```bash
   # One-command startup
   ./scripts/dev.sh  # Linux/macOS
   # or
   ./scripts/dev.ps1  # Windows
   ```

### ðŸ›  Next Steps

1. **Enhance NPU Detection** - Improve hardware detection for neural processing units
2. **Complete Desktop Packaging** - Finalize Tauri configuration for distribution
3. **Expand Testing Coverage** - Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. **Implement Memory Sync** - Framework for syncing memory across devices
